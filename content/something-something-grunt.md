## Something Something Grunt

I've been answering a lot of [questions on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gruntjs) 
lately about Grunt. I find that that tag is a little less attended to than some others and that I have 
knowledge to share. What I've discovered is that there are a lot of people new to Grunt - but familiar 
with JavaScript - who aren't sure how to accomplish what they hope to. I'd like to take a few minutes 
to talk about custom tasks in Grunt and how to use your existing JavaScript skills to make the perfect 
build process.
