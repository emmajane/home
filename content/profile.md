I'm a mild-mannered developer and evangelist by day... and, well, by night too, I suppose.

Shortly after it arrived at my home in 1993, I began disassembling our first computer - my 
mother was not happy. She breathed more easily when I moved from hardware into programming. 
I'm a contributer to a few open source projects and love participating in user groups, barcamps, 
hackathons, and conferences. I'm a fan of the Oxford comma, and in my down time I enjoy puzzles 
of all sorts and tabletop games.

I also host and help run [NomadJS](http://nomadjavascript.com), a monthly viritual usergroup 
bringing top quality conference speakers to anyone around the world. You have to keep learning 
or risk turning into a paperweight, and we're here to help. Join us every third Tuesday of the 
month for great talks, or get the video and watch afterward!

If you're into jQuery, you can check out [some plugins I maintain](/jquery) or the [Mockjax library](http://github.com/jakerella/jquery-mockjax) for testing.
